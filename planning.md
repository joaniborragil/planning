My Plan 
-The two objects I will sketch will be 
1. A circle
2. A rectangle
 Conditions of the Interaction
-The way to determine if the objects are touching will be the program will look out for the following conditions: 
The distance from the circle's center to the closest corner of the rectangle will be calculated. If the distance ends up being less than or equal to the circle's radius, it will notice the shape's "touching."
Interaction Response
I will invert the direction of movement every time the bounce effect occurs. The way I will do so is by swapping the 'dx' and 'dy' variables for the circle and rectangle to create the opposite movment.
